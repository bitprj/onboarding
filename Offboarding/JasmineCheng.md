- Which department are you part of?
   - People
- Why have you decided to leave BitProject?
   - Because it takes a lot of time, it is a good thing and a bad thing. Because I have other stuff to do and donâ€™t have that much time to commit to BitProject, so I decided to leave.
- How was your experience with the organization? Could you describe specific positives and negatives that come to mind?
   - Overall really positive experience, everyone is super nice and encourages different opinions, that makes that organization grow as a result. Bad time is that they expect a lot of time out of you, that is what I wasn't able to bring to the table.
- Could you describe the culture of the Bit Project from your perspective?
   - Encouraging learning, a lot of growth with everyone in the organization. Trying to hear others' opinions would be better.
- Was it easy to reach out for help and to contact your manager? Were you comfortable with doing so? 
   - yes
- What suggestions do you have for us? How could we have improved your experience?
   - Making it clear on what I need to do, and how much time I need to take in the beginning would help a lot. Try to  listen to other people talk.

- Did you feel equipped to do the work assigned in your department? Was it difficult to use the applications?
  - yes
  
- Was there anything that was unclear with your goals and objectives? 
  - Unclear in the beginning, but the goal is cleared later.
