- Do you want your name to be included in the offboarding feedback?
  - yes
- This member just joint BitProject and have not yet finished the onboarding process. She needs to leave since she has other things to do and could not commit time during the Summer. And the only feedback she has is 
   - people could be more transparent on organizing.
- Thank you for all of the hard work you did for Bit Project as without you we would never progress forward. You will now be removed from all applications and will no longer be part of the organization. If you wish to rejoin, you must reapply through the website: bitproject.org/join.
