   - marketing
- Why have you decided to leave BitProject?
   - The position I am having right now is not the position I initially wanted, didn't see much value with what I want my job to be in the future.
   - There was lack of communication between members. A lot of work flow changes brought up the issue that wondn't clear with my role and my plan.
- How was your experience with the organization? Could you describe specific positives and negatives that come to mind?
   - Definitely gained valuable skills in technical writing, and CS skill. Social experience was not the greatest since there were lack of communication. 
- Could you describe the culture of the Bit Project from your perspective?
   - positives: types of work we are doing is quite advanced as a student organization, we have culture of being productive. 
   - negatives: A lot of time consuming, sometimes spend whole day just wirking on BitProject stuff.
- Was it easy to reach out for help and to contact your manager? Were you comfortable with doing so? 
   - I was unclear with who to contact for the first quarter. It was hard to ask for help. President changes his mind a lot, and difficult to reach out until the time he changes his mind. President tends to not realize alternative ideas, and it is hard to actually approach.
- What suggestions do you have for us? How could we have improved your experience?
   - Definitely make sure that we are not only transparent to public, also in our own organization. Since there were a lot of lack of communication. If you want to rearrange the roles of someone, you need to make sure you provide an explanation including all party involved. Everyone needs to be in an agreement. 
   - If there is any worflow changes, make sure to have enough time to test it. Can't be 5 or 6 workflow changes in a quarter. workflow changes were changed very quick and there is no time to adjust for people.
